<h4>"Mathematics is the queen of the sciences, and number theory is the queen of mathematics." </h4>

<div>A number is a mathematical object used to count ,measure and label .</div>
<ul>
<li><div>Natural numbers: The positive integers (whole numbers) 1, 2, 3, etc., and sometimes zero as well.</div></li>

<li><div>Whole numbers: It starts from 1 ,2,3,4.......</div></li>

<li><div>Integers: A number which is not a fraction; a whole number.</div></li>
 
<li><div>Rational numbers:  A rational number is a type of real numbers, which is in the form of p/q where q is not equal to zero. Some of the examples of rational number are 1/2, 1/5, 3/4, and so on. The number “0” is also a rational number, as we can represent it in many forms such as 0/1, 0/2, 0/3, etc. But, 1/0, 2/0, 3/0, etc. are not rational, since they give us infinite values.</div></li>

<li><div>Irrational numbers: In mathematics, the irrational numbers are all the real numbers which are not rational numbers, the latter being the numbers constructed from ratios (or fractions) of integers.
Common Examples of Irrational Numbers. </div></li>

<ol>
<li>Pi, which begins with 3.14, is one of the most common irrational numbers. </li>
<li>e, also known as Euler's number, is another common irrational number. </li>
<li>The Square Root of 2, written as √2, is also an irrational number. The first part of this number would be written as 1.41421356237…but the numbers go on into infinity and do not ever repeat, and they do not ever terminate.</li>
</ol>

<li><div>Complex numbers: A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is a solution of the equation x2 = −1. Because no real number satisfies this equation, i is called an imaginary number. 
For the complex number a + bi, a is called the real part, and b is called the imaginary part. </div></li>
</ul>

<h5>NOTE:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Odd: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, . . .</li>
<li>Even: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, . . .</li>
<li>Square: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, . . .</li>
<li>Cube: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, . . .</li>
<li>Prime: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, . .</li>
</ul>

<h3>BASIC MATHS </h3>
<ul>
<li><h4>GCD OR HCF: </h4> 
<div> The greatest common divisor of two numbers a and b (not both zero)
is the largest number that divides both of them. It is denoted by
gcd(a, b). If gcd(a, b) = 1, we say that a and b are relatively prime. 

Two examples that we mentioned above are
gcd(12, 20) = 4 and gcd(18, 30) = 6 </div></li>

<li><h4>LCM:</h4>
The Least Common Multiple ( LCM ) is also referred to as the Lowest Common Multiple ( LCM ) and Least Common Divisor ( LCD) . For two integers a and b, denoted LCM(a,b), the LCM is the smallest positive integer that is evenly divisible by both a and b.
For example, LCM(2,3) = 6 and LCM(6,10) = 30.</li>

<h3>Equations:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Linear equation: A linear equation is an equation in which the highest power of the variable is always 1. It is also known as a one-degree equation. The standard form of a linear equation in one variable is of the form Ax + B = 0. Here, x is a variable, A is a coefficient and B is constant. The standard form of a linear equation in two variables is of the form Ax + By = C. Here, x and y are variables, A and B are coefficients and C is a constant.</li>

<div>Note: The smallest positive value of ax + by is equal to gcd(a, b).</div> 

<li>Quadratic equation: Quadratic equations are the polynomial equations of degree 2 in one variable of type f(x) = ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c where a, b, c, ∈ R and a ≠ 0. It is the general form of a quadratic equation where ‘a’ is called the leading coefficient and ‘c’ is called the absolute term of f (x). The values of x satisfying the quadratic equation are the roots of the quadratic equation (α,β). The quadratic equation will always have two roots. The nature of roots may be either real or imaginary.</li>

<li>Cubic Equation: A cubic equation is an algebraic equation of degree three and is of the form ax<sup>3</sup> + bx<sup>2</sup> + cx + d = 0, where a, b and c are the coefficients and d is the constant.</li>

<li>Biquadratic equation: A polynomial equation of degree four without the terms of degree three and one is known as a biquadratic equation.

<div>General Form: z<sup>4</sup> + a<sub>0</sub>z<sup>2</sup> + c = 0</div>

<div>Examples:</div>

<div> x<sup>4</sup> +16x<sup>2</sup> + 6 = 0 </div>
<div> 2x<sup>4</sup> + 14x<sup>2</sup> + 3 = 0  </div></li>
